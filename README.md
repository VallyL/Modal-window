# Simple Modal Window with Local Storage

# Features:
   - Toggle Modal: Clicking the "openModalBtn" or "closeModalBtn" will toggle the visibility of the modal window.
   - Click Anywhere to Close: Clicking outside the modal body (but within the modal window) will close the modal.
   - Escape Key Close: Pressing the Escape key will also close the modal.
   - Local Storage Persistence: The modal's visibility state is saved to local storage, so the modal will be in the same state (open or closed) on subsequent visits.

# Usage:
   - Include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project.
   - Ensure the elements with the following classes exist in your HTML:
         .openModalBtn
         .modalContainer
         .modalBody
         .closeModalWindow
   - Customize the content and styling as needed.
